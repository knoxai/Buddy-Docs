## Getting Started with Buddy.red: Three Approaches

To get started with Buddy.red, you only need two things: an API URL endpoint and an Access Token. Below are three ways to set up and use Buddy.red:

1. **Buddy.works Cloud Account Registration**
2. **Buddy On-Premises**
3. **Buddy & Buddy.red On-Premises (Enterprise) Installation & Configuration Services**

### 1. Buddy.works Cloud Account Registration

To use Buddy.red with a Buddy.works cloud account:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account at [Buddy.works](https://buddy.works/sign-up).

#### API Endpoints

Depending on your account location, use one of the following API endpoints:

- **US Accounts**:  
  For accounts starting with `app.buddy.works`:
  ```bash
  https://api.buddy.works
  ```

- **EU Accounts**:  
  For accounts starting with `eu.buddy.works`:
  ```bash
  https://api.eu.buddy.works
  ```

### 2. Buddy On-Premises

For those using Buddy in an on-premises environment, the API endpoint will be determined by your server configuration:

- If using an IP address:
  ```bash
  https://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/api
  ```
- If using a custom domain:
  ```bash
  https://YOUR-DOMAIN/api
  ```

Once you have your API endpoint and Access Token, go to [Buddy.red](https://buddy.red) to input these details and start connecting with Buddy.red.
