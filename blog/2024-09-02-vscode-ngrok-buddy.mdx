This method revolutionizes front-end development by enabling direct testing within a container environment using Visual Studio Code. Unlike the traditional approach of using VS Code's built-in port forwarding, this method offers a more streamlined and efficient workflow. By testing your front-end code directly inside the container, you eliminate the complexities and potential issues associated with port forwarding. This approach ensures that your development environment closely mirrors production, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior when deploying. As a result, it significantly accelerates the development cycle and improves the overall reliability of your code.
